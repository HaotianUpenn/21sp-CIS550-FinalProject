FIFA Project: Website made for a small FIFA tournament to be hosted on a local area network

# website details
Nodejs backend and React for the frontend compiled using webpack to be served by the Nodejs server

Instructions for building it locally:
1. Check if you already have Node installed. (Open terminal and type node -v; npm -v to check what version, if any, of node and npm are installed on your machine. If these commands are not recognized, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the Node.js for your system. Having multiple versions sometimes causes issues that are hard to debug.)
2. Open terminal, cd into the ./client directory.
3. Type npm install. This will download all the required client-side dependencies, which are specified in package.json into the node_modules/ directory. It may take a while.
4. cd into the ./server directory.
5. Type npm install. This will download all the required server-side dependencies.
6. While in the /server folder, type "npm start" in the terminal to start the server. By default, itâ€™s running on port 8081. You should see a message in the Terminal saying "Server listening on PORT 8081". Then in the /client folder, type "npm start", you are expected to see the main pages http://localhost:3000/Leader%20Board.
